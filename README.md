# Rohirrim Toy Robot

This project implements a simple toy robot simulation. The robot can be placed on a tabletop grid and moved in different directions.

## Testing

To run the tests for this project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies by running:
   `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
2. Run the tests:
   `npm run test`

## Notes

Due to dependency conflicts, the Enzyme testing library has been removed from this project. If time were not a constraint, I (Aiden) would work on resolving the conflicts so that I could more thoroughly test component state.
